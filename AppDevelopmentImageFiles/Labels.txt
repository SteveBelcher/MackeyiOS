People look at food labels for different reasons. Whatever the reason, you might like to know how to use this information more effectively and easily.  The following label-building skills are intended to make it easier for you to use nutrition labels to make quick, informed food choices that contribute to a healthy diet.

Serving Size
Check to see if your serving is the same size as the one  on the label.  If you eat double the serving size listed, you need to double the nutrient and caloric values.  If you eat one-half the serving size shown here, the nutrient and caloric values should be halved.

Calories
Look here to see what a serving of food adds to your daily total.  A person’s size and activity level help determine total calories needed per day.  For example, a 138-lb active woman needs about 2,000 calories each day, while a 160-lb active woman needs about 2,300.


Total Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are found in foods like bread, potatoes, fruits, and vegetables.  They should be the basis for your diet, giving you nutrients and energy.  If you cut down on fat, you can eat more carbohydrates.

Dietary Fiber
It is important to consume both soluble and insoluble diatary fiber (also called “roughage”).  Fruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, beans, and legumes are all good sources of fiber and can help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.

Protein
Most adults get more protein than they need.  Protein from animal sources contains both fat and cholesterol, so eat small servings of lean meat, fish, and poultry.  Use skim or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese.  Try to get your protein from some vegetables (such as beans), grains, and cereals.

Vitamins & Minerals
Make it your goal to get 100% of each every day.  Let a combination of foods contribute to a winning score.

Saturated Fat
Saturated fat is the “bad” fat.  It is the key player in raising blood cholesterol and your risk of heart disease.  Avoid it!

Total Fat
Try to limit your calories from fat.  Too much fat may contribute to heart disease and cancer.  Choose foods with fewer than 30% of calories derived from fat.

Cholesterol
Challenge yourself to eat foods totaling less than 300 mg of cholesterol each day.  Too much cholesterol can lead to heart disease.

Sodium
Too much sodium (or salt) adds up to high blood pressure in some people.  Keep your sodium intake low - 2,400 to 3,000 mg per day is plenty.The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than 3,000 mg of sodium per day for healthy adults. 

Daily Values
These daily values apply to people who eat 2,000 to 2,500 calories each day.  If you eat more, your personal daily value may be higher than what’s listed on the label.  If you eat less, your personal daily value may be lower.Aim for low percent daily values when it comes to fats, cholesterol, and sodium, while aiming for 100% of carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
