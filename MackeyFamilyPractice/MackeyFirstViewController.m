Temperatures of 100 - 103 degrees are usual with childhood infections and help combat disease.  Temperatures of 104 degrees and above may cause convulsions in infants - and chills in older children and adults.  Sudden changes in temperature can precipitate convulsions in infants (up to 2 years of age). Temperatures of 105 degrees and above if prolonged can cause brain damage.\n\nFacts:\nA normal temperature is about 98.6 degrees when taken orally (by mouth).  Temperatures taken rectally (by rectum) usually run 1 degree higher than those taken orally.  Auxiliary temperatures run 1 degree than those then orally.  Temperatures will register lower after sleeping, becoming chilled, or drinking colds liquids.  Temperatures will register higher after exercising, exposure to higher environmental temperatures, and drinking hot liquids.\n\nTreatment:\nFor high fevers that are difficult to bring down with aspirin or Tylenol alone, try the following:  alternate aspirin and Tylenol in the appropriate does for child's weight and age every 2 hours.\n\nTips:\n1. For a child having an elevated temperature, give aspirin or Tylenol every three-four hours.  You should take their temperature at least every 2-4 hours.\n\n2.  Place the child in a tub of luke-warm water and sponge briskly for 15 minutes.  If the child's temperature is still elevated, continue sponging for an additional 15 minutes.  Sponge the child no more frequently than every 2 hours and no longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Remember, not to child the child as this will prohibit the fever from going down and may even cause it to rise.\n\n3.  A fever does not necessary indicate a dangerous infection.  A child's temperature regulating mechanism is not well developed and thus, the fever is often higher than one would expect with relatively minor infection.\n\n4.  Follow the doctor's orders with regard to antibiotics and other medications.\n\n5.  Call your family doctor immediately if the child twitches, convulses, or it spots or rash appear.\n\n6.  With viral infections, it is recommended to use Tylenol instead of aspirin because of the association of Reeve's Syndrome with aspirin.\n\nThe information above is for educational purposes only.
